	abstract = {I describe a new species of Oreophryne from Woodlark Island, the most isolated large island in southeastern Papua New Guinea. The new species is a member of the O. equus species group, characterized by having a "whinny" call consisting of a rapid series of high-pitched peeps. It differs from other members of that group in a combination of features, including having a cartilaginous connection between the scapula and procoracoid, well-webbed digits on the feet, fifth toe longer than the third, a largely unicolor brown dorsum, and red flash markings on the hidden surfaces of the thighs. All members of this species group inhabit the southeasternmost portion of Papua New Guinea, with most species endemic to single offshore islands. The species is common in secondary rain forests on Woodlark, but continued commercial interest in developing large-scale extractive industries on the island could potentially threaten this and other endemic species on Woodlark if developments were to occur across a large-enough area of the island.},

@article{Kraus2016,
	abstract = {Oreophryne presently represents the second-most-diverse genus of microhylid frogs, with 57 named species, most occurring on New Guinea and its satellite islands. Nonetheless, a diversity of species remains to be described. Using morphological, color-pattern, and advertisement-call data, I describe ten new species of Oreophryne from the Papuan Peninsula of New Guinea and adjacent islands, which together form the East Papuan Composite Terrane. All but two of these species can be placed into two species groups based on call type. I refer to these species groups as the O. anser group and the O. equus group, both being based on species described herein. Members of the O. anser group produce calls reminiscent of a goose honk, whereas members of the O. equus group produce calls reminiscent of a horse's whinny. Description of three new species in the O. anser group requires me to first rediagnose O. loriae, which has previously been interpreted as including the frogs named herein as O. anser sp. nov. The honk call type has not previously been reported within Oreophryne, and the whinny call may be novel as well, although it is possibly derived from other New Guinean species having calls consisting of a slower series of peeps. Based on their unique call types, I hypothesize that both species groups are monophyletic. If true, each would appear endemic to the East Papuan Composite Terrane. Only five additional species of Oreophryne are known from this region that do not belong to one or the other of these two species groups; hence, these newly identified species groups represent the majority of diversity in Oreophryne from the Papuan Peninsula and its satellite islands.},

	abstract = {We describe, from the Muller Range of New Guinea, three new species of microhylid frogs, one each in the genera Albericus, Cophixalus, and Oreophryne. The new Albericus is unique in its combination of having an infrequent peeping call, oblique lores, wide snout and finger discs, and distinct tympanum. The new Cophixalus is distinguished by its combination of finger discs larger than toe discs, third toe longer than fifth, distinct tympanum, curved scapular ridges, dark postocular stripe, dark W-shaped mark above the shoulders, and having a call consisting of a rapid series of 6-9 musical peeps. The Oreophryne is unique in its combination of having a cartilaginous connection of the procoracoid to the scapula, no webbing between the toes, fifth toe longer than third, short snout, dark face, and call consisting of an extended multi-note chuckle or cackle. Each species was either common or abundant. The new Cophixalus shows a predilection for caves, although it is not restricted to them. Many frogs occurring in the central highlands of New Guinea are wide-ranging across much of this high-elevational region, but others are of restricted distribution. The species described herein are likely members of the latter group, although it remains to be determined whether each will prove endemic to the Muller Range.},

	abstract = {Asterophryinae is a large monophyletic subfamily of Anurans containing over 300 species distributed across one of the world's most geologically active areas -- New Guinea and its satellite islands, Australia and the Philippines. The tremendous ecological and morphological diversity of this clade, with apparent specializations for burrowing, terrestrial, semi-aquatic, and arboreal lifestyle, suggests an evolutionary process of adaptive radiation. Despite this spectacular diversity, this and many other questions of evolutionary processes have received little formal study because until now the phylogeny of this spececies-rich clade has remained uncertain. Here we reconstruct a phylogeny for Asterophryinae with greatly increased taxon and genetic sampling relative to prior studies. We use Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian Inference methods to produce the most robust and comprehensive phylogeny to date containing 155 species using 3 nuclear and 2 mitochondrial loci. We also perform a time calibration analysis to estimate the age of the clade. We find support for the monophyly of Asterophryinae as well as need for taxonomic reclassification of several genera. Furthermore, we find increased rates of speciation across the clade supporting the hypothesis of rapid radiation. Lastly, we found that adding taxa to the analysis produced more robust phylogenetic results over adding loci.},

@article{Hill2022,
	abstract = {The microhylid frogs of the New Guinea region are the largest and most ecologically diverse subfamily (Asterophryinae) of one of the largest anuran families in the world and can live in communities of up to 20 species. While there has been recent progress in resolving the phylogenetic relationships of Asterophryinae, significant uncertainties remain, impeding further progress in understanding the evolution of microhabitat use, parental care, and life history variation in this group. In particular, the early divergences at the base of the tree remain unclear; as does the monophyly of some genera; and recent studies have discovered that species with wide geographic distribution are instead cryptic species complexes. In this study, we fortified geographic sampling of the largest previous phylogenetic effort by sequencing an additional 62 taxa and increased data quality and quantity by adding new layers of data vetting and by filling in previously incomplete loci to the five gene dataset (2 mitochondrial, 3 nuclear protein-coding genes) to obtain a dataset that is now 99% complete in over 2400 characters for 233 samples (205 taxa) of Asterophryinae and 3 outgroup taxa, and analyzed microhabitat use data for these taxa from field data and data collected from the literature. Importantly, our sampling includes complete community complements at 19 sites as well as representatives at over 80 sites across New Guinea and its offshore islands. We present a highly resolved molecular phylogeny which, for the first time, has over 95% of nodes supported (84% highly supported) whether using Maximum Likelihood or Bayesian Inference, allowing clarification of all genera (whether monophyletic or clearly not), their sister genera relationships, as well as an age estimate for the Asterophryinae at approximately 20MYA. Early generic diversification occurring between 17 and 12 MYA gave rise to a surprising diversity of about 18 genera as well as the 5 putative microhabitat types. Our tree reveals extensive cryptic diversity calling any widespread taxa into doubt, and clearly demonstrates that complex multispecies communities of Asterophryinae are ecologically diverse, are numerous, and of ancient origin across New Guinea. We discuss the implications of our phylogeny for explaining the explosive diversification of Asterophryinae as the result of adaptive radiation, niche conservatism, and non-adaptive radiation.},
